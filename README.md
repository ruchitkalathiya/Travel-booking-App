There is a tree like structure where user data is being stored. In that &quot;Login-9e789&quot; is a project ID. In that there are two branches named &quot;PLANESEATS&quot; and &quot;TRAINSETS&quot;. All planes and trains remaining seats information is there. There are other branches which is named by unique user UID in which user`s all booking and account information is being stored.
